Detailed Analysis and Implementation Plan
I've analyzed the new design mockup against the current implementation. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the required changes:

Current vs. New Design Analysis
MiniPlayer (Bottom Bar)
Current Implementation:

Has visualizer orb on left
Title text with line clamp
Basic rewind/play/forward controls
Progress bar with time displays below
No speed control
No Read button
New Design Requirements:

Simplified layout without visualizer
Time display format: MM:SS on left, MM:SS on right of progress bar
Add 1x speed control button
Cleaner skip back/forward buttons (15s back, 30s forward)
Add prominent "Read" button with grid icon on the right (orange/accent color)
More compact, refined styling
Read-Along Screen
Current Implementation:

Panel slides up from bottom, leaving nav bar visible
Covers only partial screen (calc(100vh - 80px))
Has drag handle and header with chapter info
Text size dropdown in header
Close button with chevron down
New Design Requirements:

Full-screen overlay covering entire viewport (including nav bar)
Clean, distraction-free reading experience
Text with dark highlight for active segments (not orange)
Bottom control bar with:
Compact time display MM:SS / MM:SS
1x speed control
Skip back/forward controls
Play/pause button
Grid/list view toggle on right
Better typography and spacing for readability
Detailed Changes Required
1. MiniPlayer Updates
Remove visualizer orb component
Restructure layout to be more horizontal and compact
Add speed control button showing current speed (e.g., "1x")
Move time displays to sides of progress bar (not below)
Add "Read" button on far right with grid icon
Update skip controls to be more subtle
Refine progress bar styling
2. Read-Along Full Screen
Change positioning from sliding panel to full-screen overlay
Update z-index to cover navigation bar (z-50 or higher)
Remove drag-to-dismiss functionality
Remove header with drag handle
Add fixed bottom control bar with playback controls
Implement cleaner close mechanism
3. Read-Along Controls Bar
Create new bottom control component with:
Compact time display
Speed selector
Skip controls (-15s, +30s)
Play/pause toggle
Grid/list view toggle
Style to match the mockup's minimal design
4. Text Display Improvements
Update highlight color from orange to dark/black
Improve text spacing and line height
Optimize font size for readability
Enhance scroll behavior for active segments
Refine clickable segments interaction
5. State Management Updates
Add playback speed to audio context
Add read-along view mode state (grid/list)
Update panel visibility logic for full-screen mode
Implementation Priority
Phase 1: MiniPlayer restructuring and new controls
Phase 2: Read-Along full-screen conversion
Phase 3: Read-Along control bar implementation
Phase 4: Typography and highlighting refinements
Phase 5: Testing and polish
Technical Considerations
Need to handle safe areas for mobile devices
Ensure smooth transitions between states
Maintain audio playback continuity
Consider accessibility for controls
Test on various screen sizes
This plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the new design while maintaining functionality. The changes will significantly improve the user experience by making controls more accessible and the reading experience more immersive.
