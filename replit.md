# Audio Learning Platform

## Overview

This is a mobile-first audio learning platform built for The Institutes educational content consumption. Users access the platform directly from Moodle LMS via SSO authentication, immediately landing on their course assignments page. The application allows users to consume course materials through audio playback with synchronized text reading (Speechify-type functionality), offline downloads, progress tracking, and automatic authentication. The system is designed to support learning on-the-go scenarios such as commuting or exercising.

### Key Features
- **Synchronized Read-Along**: Real-time text highlighting synchronized with audio playback in collapsible panel
- **Dual-Layer Audio Interface**: Persistent mini-player with expandable read-along panel above
- **Performance Optimizations**: Audio pooling, batched progress tracking, and bundle optimization
- **Offline Support**: Download chapters for offline listening
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic progress saving with intelligent batching
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive interface with gesture support and safe area handling

## Previous Changes (January 18, 2025)

### UI/UX Optimizations
- **Improved Course Management Layout**: Enhanced the visual hierarchy and layout consistency across all content levels
- **Action Icons Alignment**: Action buttons (add, edit, delete) are now properly aligned to the right and only visible on hover for cleaner interface
- **Expand Arrow Positioning**: Fixed awkward placement of accordion expand arrows, now integrated properly with the trigger area
- **Content Count Display**: Assignment and chapter counts now use proper singular/plural forms and are better positioned
- **Nested Content Presentation**: Improved spacing and visual separation between courses, assignments, and chapters
- **Hover Effects**: Added smooth transitions and hover states for better user interaction feedback

### Unified Content Management System
- Created a single, unified interface for managing all educational content regardless of source (API or manual upload)
- Replaced separate content management components with UnifiedContentManager component
- Administrators can now manage courses, assignments, and chapters in one hierarchical interface
