# Login Workflow Status Report

## Current State ‚úÖ

The login workflow using Resend is now properly configured and working! Here's what has been fixed:

### 1. Base URL Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Magic links were using `http://localhost:5000` instead of the Replit domain
- **Solution**: Updated the code to prioritize Replit domains (`REPLIT_DOMAINS` or `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`) over the `APP_BASE_URL` environment variable
- **Result**: Magic links now correctly use `https://ba6e3e34-17b3-42cc-b469-d80a78ad3efe-00-3tgiotgs391a0.janeway.replit.dev`

### 2. Email Delivery Issue - PARTIALLY RESOLVED ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Current Limitations:
Your Resend account is in **test mode**, which means:
- You can only send emails to your verified email address: `benn@modia.ai`
- Emails to other addresses will be blocked by Resend

#### Development Mode Feature:
To help with testing, the system now:
1. Logs the magic link URL in the console when email sending fails
2. Still allows the authentication flow to work in development mode
3. Provides clear instructions on how to resolve the email restrictions

## How to Test the Login Flow

### Option 1: Use Your Verified Email
Send magic link requests to `benn@modia.ai` - this email will receive the actual emails.

### Option 2: Copy Magic Link from Console (Development)
1. Request a magic link for any email address
2. Check the server logs in the console
3. Copy the magic link URL that appears after "üìù Development mode: You can still test by copying this magic link:"
4. Open the link in your browser
5. You'll be logged in successfully

## To Enable Full Email Functionality

To send emails to any address, you need to:

1. **Verify a Domain** (Recommended)
   - Go to https://resend.com/domains
   - Add and verify your domain (e.g., `audiocourses.theinstituteslab.org`)
   - Update the `AUTH_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable to use an email from that domain
   - Example: `AUTH_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@audiocourses.theinstituteslab.org`

2. **Or Upgrade Your Resend Account**
   - Upgrade from the free tier to remove the test mode restrictions

## Environment Variables

### Currently Configured:
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: ‚úÖ Set and working
- `APP_BASE_URL`: Set to `http://localhost:5000` (but correctly overridden by Replit domains)
- `AUTH_FROM_EMAIL`: Not set (using default `onboarding@resend.dev`)

### Recommended Configuration:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key  # Already set
AUTH_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@yourdomain.com  # After domain verification
```

## Testing Results

‚úÖ **Magic Link Generation**: Working correctly with proper Replit domain
‚úÖ **Token Creation & Storage**: Working correctly
‚úÖ **User Creation**: New users are created successfully
‚úÖ **Session Management**: Sessions are created and cookies are set properly
‚úÖ **Redirect After Login**: Users are redirected to the home page after authentication

## Summary

The login workflow is **fully functional** from a technical perspective. The only limitation is the email delivery due to Resend account restrictions, which can be easily resolved by either:
- Testing with your verified email (`benn@modia.ai`)
- Copying magic links from the development console
- Verifying a domain in your Resend account

The system gracefully handles these limitations by providing clear feedback and alternative testing methods in development mode.
